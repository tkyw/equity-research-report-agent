### **Decomposed Task List for Company Report Generation**

#### **Part 1: Company's Core Business**
The objective of this section is to build a clear and concise understanding of what the company does, where it operates, and its primary revenue-generating activities.

*   **Task 1.1: Identify and Describe the Company's Principal Activities and Business Segments.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** What are the core services and products offered by the company? How are its operations segmented (e.g., Ultra High Purity, Process Engineering, General Contracting)?
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf`
        2.  `WEBSITE-KELINGTON-GROUP-BERHAD-AR24_spread.pdf`
    *   **Rationale/Methodology:** Scan these documents for sections titled "Corporate Profile," "Business Overview," "Our Business," or "Segmental Information." The Directors' Report section often contains a clear statement on "Principal Activities." Synthesize the descriptions from these sections to provide a comprehensive overview.

*   **Task 1.2: Determine the Company's Geographical Presence and Key Markets.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** In which countries or regions does the company operate? Which markets contribute most significantly to its revenue?
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf`
    *   **Rationale/Methodology:** Review the "Segmental Information" or "Geographical Information" note within the audited Financial Statements. This will provide a quantitative breakdown of revenue by country. Also, check the "Chairman's Statement" or "Management Discussion & Analysis" for qualitative descriptions of their key operational markets.

#### **Part 2: Financial Performance**
The objective here is to analyze the company's financial health and performance over a multi-year period to identify trends.

*   **Task 2.1: Extract Key Financial Metrics for the Last 3-5 Fiscal Years.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** What were the company's Revenue, Gross Profit, Profit Before Tax, and Net Profit After Tax for the fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023? What was the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for these years?
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf` (for 2023 and 2022 data)
        2.  `Kelington-AR2022.pdf` (for 2022 and 2021 data)
        3.  `Annual-Report-2021.pdf` (to cross-verify 2021 data)
    *   **Rationale/Methodology:** Locate the "Financial Highlights" or "Group Financial Summary" section, which is typically found at the beginning of annual reports. This provides a 5- or 10-year summary. For detailed figures, refer to the "Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income."

*   **Task 2.2: Analyze and Summarize Financial Performance Trends.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** Based on the data from Task 2.1, what is the year-over-year growth trend for revenue and net profit? Are there any notable fluctuations?
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf` (specifically the Management Discussion & Analysis section)
    *   **Rationale/Methodology:** Calculate the percentage change year-over-year for the key metrics extracted. Refer to the "Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A)" or "Financial Review" section to find management's explanation for these trends (e.g., "Revenue increased by X% due to the completion of major projects in Singapore.").

*   **Task 2.3: Summarize the Company's Financial Position.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** What are the values for Total Assets, Total Liabilities, and Total Equity as of the end of the latest fiscal year (2023)? What is the company's gearing or debt-to-equity ratio?
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf`
    *   **Rationale/Methodology:** Refer to the "Consolidated Statement of Financial Position" (also known as the Balance Sheet). Extract the total figures for assets, liabilities, and equity. Calculate the debt-to-equity ratio by dividing Total Liabilities by Total Equity to assess leverage.

#### **Part 3: Recent Developments**
This section aims to capture significant events and strategic shifts that have occurred recently, providing context beyond the financial numbers.

*   **Task 3.1: Identify Significant Corporate Achievements and Milestones in FY2022 and FY2023.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** What were the most important events for the company in the last two years? This could include major contract wins, facility expansions, new client acquisitions, or entry into new markets.
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf`
        2.  `Kelington-AR2022.pdf`
    *   **Rationale/Methodology:** Thoroughly read the "Chairman's Statement," "CEO's Message," and "Management Discussion & Analysis" sections. These narrative sections are designed to highlight the year's key achievements and operational successes. Look for phrases like "a key highlight was," "we successfully secured," or "a significant milestone."

*   **Task 3.2: Summarize Recent Strategic Initiatives.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** Has the company announced any new strategic directions, partnerships, mergers, or acquisitions?
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf`

#### **Part 4: Future Outlook**
The goal here is to provide a forward-looking perspective on the company's prospects, opportunities, and challenges.

*   **Task 4.1: Extract Management's Commentary on the Future Outlook.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** What is the management's perspective on the company's future? Are they optimistic, cautious, or concerned? What reasons do they provide?
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf`
        2.  `WEBSITE-KELINGTON-GROUP-BERHAD-AR24_spread.pdf`
    *   **Rationale/Methodology:** Search for sections explicitly titled "Outlook," "Future Prospects," or "Moving Forward." The concluding paragraphs of the "Chairman's Statement" and "MD&A" are almost always dedicated to the future outlook. Extract direct quotes or summarize the key sentiments expressed.

*   **Task 4.2: Identify Mentioned Market Trends, Opportunities, and Risks.**
    *   **Question to Answer:** What external factors (industry trends, economic conditions, technological changes) does management believe will impact the company's future performance? What are the identified growth opportunities and potential risks?
    *   **Suggested Data Source(s):**
        1.  `3.-Annual-Report-2023-FINAL.pdf`
    *   **Rationale/Methodology:** The "MD&A" and "Chairman's Statement" will discuss the market environment. Additionally, look for a "Risk Management" section, which will detail the key risks the company faces (e.g., operational, financial, market risks). Synthesize these points to build a balanced view of the future.
